## Why?

Code style helps your colleagues read and understand what your code does
(vital for QC) and also helps "future you" to remember what you were
doing if and when you revisit code later. Even if "programmer" is not in
your job description, there are certain standards and good practices
that you should be aware of to make sure that the code you write can be
understood by "future you", or any third party.

### TL;DR+ summary:

-   Use a consistent style. We suggest the tidyverse style guide because
    there are tools to easily implement it within the RStudio IDE.\
-   Capture the R session and environment information using
    session_info() or the {logrx} package function axecute(). Do this as
    a matter of routine.\
-   Unless you are writing R code functions as part of an R package,
    start your work using an {rmarkdown} document, write a narrative
    around your code and render to HTML.\
-   Don’t Repeat Yourself: Write, document and test functions. Simple
    functions compose into more complex functions. Help others by
    providing “guard rails” to prevent bad things happening with your
    functions.

(+ - “Too Long; Didn’t Read”)

In this MiniProject we're going to look at use of consistent style and
how the RStudio IDE can help you tidy up your code.

First we need some filthy, dirty code:

## Indentation = RStudio IDE shortcut CTRL+I

The first EASY thing to do is to sort out indentation. You can fix this
by selecting the code you want to reformat in the RStudio IDE and then
using the Code menu item "Reindent code" or shortcut CTRL+I. Copy the
code above into the chunk below and try the RStudio IDE "Reindent"
option...

## Reformatting = RStudio IDE shortctu CTRL+SHIFT+A

Similarly you can use the Code menu item "Reformat code" to both indent
and reformat or reflow lines of your code. Note that this doesn't
COMPLETELY reformat problems in the code below, but it's BETTER. Copy
the code above into the chunk below and try the RStudio IDE "Reformat"
option...

## Specific style issues - BE CONSISTENT

When it comes to code style, there are MANY different style guides that
you can choose from. My advice is to PICK one and then apply it
CONSISTENTLY. It's MORE important to be CONSISTENT than to be PICKY
about style.

1.  Use `<-` rather than `=`
2.  Use a consistent naming convention: \* snake_case \* camelCase
3.  Use spaces consistently. \* There should be spaces around "\<-" \*
    There should be a space after commas
4.  Use line breaks sensibly \* There should be a line break after `{`
    in function definitions \* There should be a line break after `%>%`
    or `|>` \* There should be a line break after `+` in {ggplot2}
    layers \* If a function has multiple arguments, you can split across
    lines to make it easier to read the function arguments.

You can quickly rename things in the RStudio IDE by highlighting the
item and selecting the Code menu item "Rename in scope" or
CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+M. For example, rename the item `BIGNcnt` in the code and
replace it with `big_n_cnt` in order to be consistent with
`small_n_cnt`.

Using line breaks in function calls often makes it easier to see what is
being done, rather than loading everything into a single line. In the
code above, find the `recode` function call within the `mutate`
statement and put the different cases onto separate lines like this:

```         
mutate(SEX = recode(SEX, 
                    "M" = "Male", 
                    "F" = "Female"))
```

Using indenting here, also means that the `=` line up. The benefit here
is that we can easily see that we're recoding the `SEX` variable, that
the values in that column are "M" and "F" and that we're recoding these
to "Male" and "Female" respectively. This example is trivial, but when /
if we change to a different variable where there are more options (like
`AGRGR1`) then we might want to quickly see that we have recoded all
possible options.

## Check comments

It's often tempting to ignore commented lines. But your comments should
tell others (and remind future YOU) contextual information about the
code. They provide narrative about what is happening in the code ***AND
WHY***. It's easy to read your code and figure out WHAT is happening,
but often the WHY and context is skipped over.

Read the comments. Check that they are still correct and relevant. If
not, update them.

## Don't load more libraries than you need.

Every time you load a library you also load its dependencies. Why load a
package if it's not needed in the code? When you are developing code
it's tempting to load the {tidyverse} library so that everything you
need is at your fingertips. But once the code is done, it may be more
sensible to strip back to only the packages you needed. e.g. Didn't make
a graph? Why load {ggplot2}?

Copy the original code into the chunk below and try to tidy it up.

```{r}
library(rio)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

## Don't Repeat Yourself - DRY principle

Notice that we have three different code chunks that effectively do the
same task. Somebody has copy and pasted the same code three times to
make the calculation for different demography characteristics. This is
problematic. Not least because it can introduce errors, as in the case
above. Also, if you make a typo in the code (as in the case above) then
it can sometimes be hard to pinpoint. Can you spot it?

Note also that the code calculates the `BIGNcnt` three times. Which is
just unnecessary. We now know about functions. So what could we do here?
Copy and paste your tidied code above into the chunk below and try to
resolve this issue using your experience at writing functions.

```{r}

library(rlang) # Needed for tidy evaluation
 
## Import dataset
adsl_saf <- import("https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/raw/master/data/adam/cdisc/adsl.xpt") %>% filter(SAFFL == "Y")
 
## Create function
demog_sum <- function(data, var) {
  var_sym <- sym(var) # Convert string to symbol for tidy evaluation
 
  # Calculate total counts by treatment
  bigncnt <- data %>%
    group_by(TRT01AN, TRT01A) %>%
    count(name = "N")
 
  # Calculate counts for each category
  calc_cnts <- function(var_sym) {
    small_n_cnt <- data %>%
      group_by(TRT01AN, TRT01A, !!var_sym) %>%
      count(name = "n")
    adsl_mrg_cnt <- small_n_cnt %>%
      left_join(bigncnt, by = c("TRT01A", "TRT01AN")) %>%
      mutate(perc = round((n / N) * 100, digits = 1),
             perc_char = format(perc, nsmall = 1),
             npct = paste(n, paste0("(", perc_char, ")"))) %>%
      ungroup()
 
    # Conditional recoding for SEX
    if (var == "SEX") {
      adsl_mrg_cnt <- adsl_mrg_cnt %>%
        mutate(SEX = recode(SEX, "M" = "Male", "F" = "Female"))
    }
 
  return(adsl_mrg_cnt)
  }
 
  # Summarize the table for each category

    pivot_wider(names_from = TRT01A, values_from = npct)
  return(summary_counts)
}
